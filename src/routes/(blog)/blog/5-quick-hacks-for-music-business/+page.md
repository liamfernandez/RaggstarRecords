# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# The 5 Hacks

The era of needing a major label to succeed is over. Today, independent artists have tools to achieve success on their terms. These five hacks will give you the upper hand.



1. **Own Your Masters**
    * Retaining rights means you keep earning revenue every time your music is streamed or licensed. Use platforms like DistroKid to distribute music independently.
2. **License for Sync**
    * Sync licensing opens doors to lucrative opportunities in film, TV, and commercials. Platforms like Taxi or Songtradr can connect your music to these projects.
3. **Leverage Analytics**
    * Platforms like Chartmetric and Spotify for Artists help you understand what’s working and where to focus your energy.
4. **Build Direct Relationships**
    * Collect fan emails to communicate directly, bypassing the algorithms of social platforms.
5. **Collaborate Strategically**
    * Teaming up with other artists expands your audience and creates fresh content.


# How to Apply These Hacks



* Use licensing to generate passive income while expanding your exposure.
* Focus on platforms that offer artist-centric data to refine your marketing strategies.
* Host live events with collaborators or release joint singles to increase visibility.

With these hacks, you don’t just compete—you dominate. Independence is your superpower.
