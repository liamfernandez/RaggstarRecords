# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# Choosing the Right Distribution Platform

In today's digital music landscape, music distribution is a critical skill for independent artists. Effective distribution can significantly expand your reach, increase your revenue, and boost your career. This blog post will provide you with actionable strategies to distribute your music successfully, ensuring that your tracks reach the right audience at the right time.

Selecting the right distribution platform is crucial. Here are some factors to consider:



* **Cost:** Look at the fees and commissions charged by the platform. Some charge upfront fees, while others take a percentage of your revenue.
* **Reach:** Ensure the platform can get your music onto major streaming services and digital stores. You want your music to be as ubiquitous as cat videos on the internet.

* **Services Offered:** Some platforms offer additional services like marketing support, playlist pitching, and analytics. It’s like getting the deluxe package with extra fries.

**Which One Do I Choose?**



* **TuneCore:** Known for its wide reach and detailed analytics, but it charges annual fees. Think of it as the premium gym membership of distribution platforms. Sign up for TuneCore [here](https://www.tunecore.com/)
* **DistroKid:** Offers unlimited uploads for a flat annual fee, making it cost-effective for prolific artists. Perfect for artists who upload frequently. Sign up for Distrokidd [here](https://distrokid.com/mymusic/)
* **CD Baby:** Charges a one-time fee per release and provides a range of additional services, including sync licensing. It’s like the reliable old friend who always shows up with snacks. Sign up for CD Baby [here](https://cdbaby.com/)
* **Amuse:** Offers a free tier with basic distribution services and a Pro tier with additional benefits. Kind of like a free sample at the grocery store – try before you buy. Sign up for Amuse [here](https://www.amuse.io/en/)


# Preparing Your Music for Distribution

Preparation is key to a successful release.



* **High-Quality Recordings:** Ensure your tracks are professionally recorded, mixed, and mastered. You wouldn’t serve a half-baked cake, so don’t release half-baked music.
* **Album Artwork:** Create compelling and high-resolution artwork that meets the specifications of the distribution platform. Because we all judge a book by its cover, or in this case, an album by its artwork.
* **Metadata:** Properly tag your music with all relevant information, including song title, artist name, album title, genre, and release date. It’s the musical equivalent of labeling your leftovers.
* **PRO Registration:** Register your music with Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) like ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC to ensure you receive royalties for public performances. You deserve to get paid when your track is the jam at someone’s wedding.

# Promoting Your Release

To maximize the reach of your music, consider these strategies:



* **Building Anticipation:** Use teasers, countdowns, and pre-save campaigns on platforms like Spotify to generate excitement. Think of it as the foreplay before the big musical climax.
* **Streaming Services and Playlists:** Aim to get your music on curated playlists, which can significantly boost your streams. Use tools like [SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/) to pitch your tracks to playlist curators.
* **Social Media Promotion:** Leverage platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to promote your release. Create engaging content that resonates with your audience. If you build it (a good social media strategy), they will come.


# TLDR

Mastering music distribution is essential for independent artists aiming to succeed in today's music industry. By choosing the right platform, preparing effectively, and promoting strategically, you can significantly enhance your reach and impact. Stay persistent, be adaptable, and continually refine your approach based on what you learn.
