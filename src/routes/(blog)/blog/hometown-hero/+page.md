# Introduction
Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# Understanding Your Local Music Scene

As an independent artist, your local music scene isn't just a community; it's your launching pad. Whether you're aiming to grow your fan base, network with other musicians, or score bigger gigs, the connections and reputation you build locally can open doors to greater opportunities. This guide delves into strategies to not only navigate but also thrive in your local music scene.

### Defining Your Scene

Begin by defining the unique characteristics of your local scene. What genres flourish? Who attends the gigs? Understanding these dynamics will help you tailor your music and performances to the audience that's most likely to support you.

1. **Research the Audience:** Look at the demographics of those who attend local gigs. Are they mostly young people, college students, working professionals, or a mix? Understanding your audience will help you tailor your performances and marketing efforts.
2. **Identify Popular Genres:** What types of music are most popular in your area? Knowing which genres have a strong following can help you position yourself effectively and collaborate with the right artists.
3. **Analyze Successful Artists:** Look at local artists who have gained a significant following. What are they doing right? What can you learn from their approach?

### Researching Venues and Events

Identify venues that cater to your style of music and are known for supporting local artists. Attend events to get a feel for the audience and make notes on how other artists engage them.

1. **Make a List of Venues:** Compile a list of local venues that regularly host live music. Note their size, typical audience, and the genres they prefer.
2. **Attend Local Shows:** Visit these venues and observe. Pay attention to how artists interact with the audience, the type of music that gets the best response, and the overall atmosphere.
3. **Network with Venue Owners:** Introduce yourself to the owners and staff. Building a rapport with them can lead to future gig opportunities.


# Building Relationships Locally
