# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# How to Book a Show

As an independent artist, booking shows and finding a manager can feel like navigating a maze with no map. But don't worry—you're not alone. Every artist has to figure out these essential steps at some point, and with the right approach, you can master the process. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about booking your own shows and finding a manager, all while keeping things sharp, detailed, and a bit lighthearted. Because, hey, who said the business side of music had to be boring?


## Step 1: Define Your Goals and Audience

Before you start emailing every venue in town, take a step back. Why do you want to book this show? Are you looking to build a local following, test out new material, or maybe even impress that one special person who's finally coming to see you live? Knowing your goals will help you target the right venues and approach the booking process with purpose.

**Target Audience Insight:** Understanding your audience is like knowing the secret sauce to your music's success. If your fans are more into laid-back acoustic vibes, that heavy metal bar downtown might not be the best fit. Find out where your fans hang out—both online and offline—and let that guide your venue choices.


## Step 2: Build a Professional Press Kit

Your Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is like your musical resume, and just like any resume, it needs to make you look like a star. A well-crafted EPK should include:



* **A killer bio:** Keep it short, sweet, and packed with personality. Highlight your achievements and what makes your music unique.
* **Professional photos:** These should be high-quality images that capture your vibe. No blurry selfies, please!
* **Music samples:** Include your best tracks—preferably in the form of links to platforms like SoundCloud or Spotify.
* **Live performance videos:** Show them you can rock the stage. Even a solid clip from a previous gig can do wonders.
* **Press coverage:** If you’ve got it, flaunt it. Link to any articles, interviews, or reviews that show you’re worth listening to.

**Pro Tip:** Your EPK isn’t just for venues. It’s your all-in-one tool for networking, reaching out to media, and—yes—impressing potential managers. Refer to the “How to Build a Killer Press Kit” blog for more info.


## Step 3: Research Potential Venues

Finding the right venue is a bit like dating—you’re looking for that perfect match. Start by making a list of venues in your area that host artists similar to you. Pay attention to:



* **Venue Size:** Too big, and you’ll feel like you’re playing to an empty room. Too small, and you’ll be cramming fans into a space that’s way too tight. Find that Goldilocks spot.
* **Vibe and Audience:** Does the venue attract your type of crowd? If you’re a soulful R&B singer, a punk rock dive might not be your scene.
* **Location, Location, Location:** Choose venues in areas where your target audience hangs out. If you’re a local hero in your neighborhood, stick close to home; if you’re looking to expand, branch out to new spots.

**Research Tools: \
**Check out venue websites, social media pages, and platforms like Bandsintown or Songkick to see where similar artists are playing. This can give you a good idea of where you might fit.


## Step 4: Reach Out to Venues

You’ve got your EPK polished and your target venues listed—now it’s time to make contact. Your goal here is to stand out without being overwhelming. Here’s how:



* **Personalize Your Message:** Address the booking manager by name and mention why you’re reaching out to their specific venue. Show that you’ve done your homework.
* **Keep It Concise:** Booking managers are busy, so get to the point quickly. Include the essentials—who you are, what you’re about, and why you’d be a great fit.
* **Include Your EPK:** Attach your EPK or link to it online. Make sure it’s easy to access and well-organized.

**Sample Email:**

Subject: Live Performance Opportunity – [Your Band/Artist Name]

## Step 5: Follow Up

You sent the email, and now the waiting game begins. But don’t just sit there twiddling your thumbs. If you haven’t heard back in a week, it’s time for a polite follow-up.



* **Be Friendly, Not Pushy:** A simple, “Just checking in to see if you had a chance to review my previous email” works wonders.
* **Stay Positive:** Even if you get a “no,” thank them for their time and keep the door open for future opportunities.


## Step 6: Negotiate Terms

When you get that “yes,” it’s time to talk details. Here’s what to consider:



* **Payment Structure:** Understand how the venue handles artist compensation. It could be a flat fee, a percentage of the door, or even a split of bar sales.
* **Logistics:** Confirm the date, time, soundcheck, and equipment provided. Get all the details in writing to avoid any last-minute surprises.
* **Promotion:** Clarify who’s responsible for promoting the event. Will the venue handle some of the marketing, or is it all on you?


## Step 7: Promote Your Show

Now that you’ve booked the gig, it’s time to fill the room. Here’s how:



* **Social Media Blitz:** Create event pages on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Share regular updates and countdowns to build excitement.
* **Engage with Fans:** Use polls, questions, and behind-the-scenes content to get your fans involved and invested.
* **Collaborate with the Venue:** Coordinate with the venue’s marketing team to leverage their audience. Cross-promotion can help reach new fans.

**Creative Ideas: \
**Consider making a teaser video or a “day in the life” vlog leading up to the show. Personal touches like these can generate buzz and make your event more memorable.


## Step 8: Deliver a Great Performance

The big day is here! To ensure your show goes off without a hitch:



* **Be Professional:** Arrive early, be prepared, and treat everyone—staff, fans, and fellow musicians—with respect.
* **Engage the Audience:** Your performance is about more than just playing music; it’s about connecting with the crowd. Talk to them, involve them, and make them feel part of the experience.
* **Post-Show Interaction:** Stick around after the show to meet fans, sign merch, and take photos. This personal touch can turn casual listeners into loyal followers.
