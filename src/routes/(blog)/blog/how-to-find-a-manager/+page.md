# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# Understand the Role of a Manager

Before you start your search, it’s crucial to know what a manager can and should do for you. A good manager will:



* **Handle Business Affairs:** They’ll take care of negotiations, contracts, and all the boring (but essential) paperwork.
* **Book Gigs:** While you’re focusing on your music, your manager will be finding and booking the right shows for you.
* **Marketing Strategies:** They’ll help you craft a brand, market your music, and grow your audience.
* **Career Guidance:** They’re your partner in crime, helping you make decisions that align with your long-term goals.

**Why You Need One: \
**If you’re serious about taking your music career to the next level, a manager can be your biggest asset. They handle the business so you can focus on your art.


# Step 2: Assess Your Needs

Before diving into the search, take a moment to reflect on what you really need:



* **Identify Pain Points:** Are you struggling with booking shows, managing social media, or finding the right contacts? A manager can fill these gaps.
* **Set Clear Goals:** Knowing where you want to go in your career will help you find a manager who shares your vision and can help you get there.

**Pro Tip:** Make a list of what you’re currently handling and what you’d like to offload to a manager. This will clarify your needs and make your search more focused.


# Step 3: Build Your Network

Networking isn’t just about shaking hands and trading business cards—it’s about building genuine relationships. Here’s how to do it effectively:



* **Attend Industry Events:** Music conferences, workshops, and local gigs are prime spots to meet potential managers. Don’t just aim to collect contacts; aim to make meaningful connections.
* **Leverage Social Media:** LinkedIn and Instagram are powerful tools for networking. Engage with industry professionals, comment on their posts, and share your insights. The goal is to get noticed without being overly self-promotional.
* **Use Your Existing Network:** Reach out to fellow musicians, producers, and other contacts who might know a good manager looking for new talent. Referrals are often the best way to find someone trustworthy.

**Networking Tip:** When attending events, always have your EPK ready to share. Whether it’s digital or printed, being prepared shows professionalism and seriousness about your career.


# Step 4: Identify Potential Managers

Finding a manager is a bit like dating—you need to find someone who’s a good fit for you. Start by researching:



* **Industry Experience:** Look for managers who have a track record with artists in your genre. They should have connections that can open doors for you.
* **Reputation:** Ask around or do some online sleuthing. A manager with a solid reputation in the industry is worth their weight in gold.
* **Personal Compatibility:** It’s not just about business—your manager will be your partner in your career journey. Make sure you can see yourself working closely with them.

**Where to Look:**
Industry databases, LinkedIn, and even music industry conferences can be great places to start your search. Don’t forget to check out the rosters of managers who work with artists you admire.


# Step 5: Prepare Your Pitch

When you’re ready to reach out, you’ll need to pitch yourself in a way that makes managers see your potential:



* **Create a Standout EPK:** By now, you know the drill—bio, music, videos, press. Make sure it’s top-notch.
* **Craft a Clear Pitch:** Your pitch should explain who you are, what you’ve achieved, and why you’re seeking a manager. Highlight what you bring to the table and what you’re looking to achieve.
* **Showcase Your Potential:** Include any impressive stats—streaming numbers, social media engagement, and press coverage. Managers are more likely to take you on if they see you have momentum.

# Step 6: Meet and Evaluate

Once you’ve made contact, it’s time to meet potential managers and see if they’re a good fit. Here’s how to approach it:



* **Initial Meeting:** This is your chance to discuss your career goals, their management style, and how they envision helping you. Be open, but also critical—this is your career, after all.
* **Ask the Right Questions:** Find out about their experience, how they handle challenges, and what their expectations are. Make sure they’re as invested in your success as you are.
* **Evaluate Chemistry:** You’ll be working closely together, so it’s crucial to have a good rapport. If something feels off, trust your gut.

**What to Watch For: \
**Red flags include vague answers, over-promising, or a lack of transparency. A good manager will be honest, clear, and realistic about what they can offer.


# Step 7: Discuss Terms and Contracts

If you’ve found a manager you want to work with, it’s time to talk terms:



* **Understand the Agreement:** Review the contract thoroughly. Key points to focus on include commission rates (usually 15-20%), duration, and exclusivity.
* **Seek Legal Advice:** It’s always a good idea to have an entertainment lawyer review the contract to ensure your interests are protected.
* **Set Clear Expectations:** Make sure you both understand the roles and responsibilities. This will prevent misunderstandings down the road.

**Contract Tip:** Don’t be afraid to negotiate. This is your career, and it’s essential to ensure the terms are fair and beneficial.


# Step 8: Maintain a Professional Relationship

Once you have a manager, the work doesn’t stop. Here’s how to build a strong, professional relationship:



* **Regular Communication:** Keep in touch with your manager frequently. Discuss your progress, upcoming opportunities, and any concerns.
* **Set Milestones:** Work together to establish short-term and long-term goals. This helps track your career growth and ensures you’re both on the same page.
* **Be Open and Honest:** Transparency is key. Share your thoughts, ideas, and any challenges you’re facing. A good manager will appreciate your openness and work with you to overcome obstacles.

**Relationship Tip:** Remember, your manager is there to help you succeed. Treat them with respect, be clear about your needs, and keep the lines of communication open.


### Additional Tips



* **Be Patient:** Finding the right manager takes time. Don’t rush into an agreement with someone who isn’t the right fit.
* **Show Commitment:** Managers want to see that you’re serious about your career. Demonstrate your dedication through your work ethic and professionalism.
* **Keep Improving:** Even with a manager, your journey as an artist is about continuous growth. Keep honing your craft, and don’t stop pushing your boundaries.
