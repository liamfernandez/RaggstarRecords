# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# 1. Understanding the Types of Spotify Playlists

In today’s music industry, playlists are more than just a way to discover new music—they’re a crucial part of an artist’s career growth. For independent R&B and hip-hop artists, landing on the right Spotify playlists can skyrocket your exposure, increase streams, and boost your fanbase. But how do you successfully pitch your music to Spotify playlists, especially as an indie artist?

This guide will walk you through the steps of getting your tracks featured on Spotify's editorial, algorithmic, and user-generated playlists. Let’s get started.

Before you start pitching, it’s important to understand the three main types of Spotify playlists and how they function.


#### **Editorial Playlists**

These playlists are curated by Spotify’s in-house editorial team. They’re typically genre-specific and are among the most followed on the platform. Landing a spot on a major editorial playlist like[ RapCaviar](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd) or[ Chill R&B](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EIfeeY1Nyg89M) can give your track a huge boost, but competition is fierce.


#### **Algorithmic Playlists**

These playlists are automatically generated based on user listening habits and behaviors. Examples include[ Discover Weekly](https://www.spotify.com/us/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWnMZKMl7SWB/) and[ Release Radar](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/release-radar-how-to-get-your-music-on-your-fans-weekly-playlist). To make the most of these playlists, you’ll need to drive engagement and streams to trigger the algorithm’s attention.


#### **User-Generated Playlists**

Curated by individual Spotify users or influencers, these playlists can have anywhere from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of followers. While they might not have the reach of editorial playlists, getting featured on popular user-generated playlists is often easier and can lead to organic growth.


# 2. Preparing Your Track for Playlist Submission

Before you submit your track for playlist consideration, it’s essential to ensure that your music and branding are polished.


#### **Ensure High-Quality Production**

First and foremost, your music needs to be **broadcast-quality**. If your track is poorly mixed or mastered, it’s unlikely to catch the attention of curators. Make sure to hire professional **mixing and mastering services** if necessary to get your track sounding as polished as possible.


#### **Metadata and Branding**

Spotify curators expect accuracy and professionalism, so double-check that all your track metadata is correct. This includes:



* Song title
* Artist name
* Genre and sub-genre
* Release date

Your artist profile on[ Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/) should be fully optimized. That means:



* Having a high-quality artist photo
* A detailed bio that reflects your story and style
* Active links to your social media and website

This not only helps curators know more about you but also presents you as a serious artist with a cohesive brand.


# 3. Using Spotify for Artists to Pitch

Spotify provides a built-in tool specifically for pitching your music to their editorial team. This tool is only available through[ Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/) and applies to unreleased music.


#### **The Built-In Pitching Tool**

Here’s how to make the most of this feature:



* **Submit unreleased music:** You need to pitch your music **at least 2-3 weeks** before the release date to give curators enough time to consider it.
* **Provide detailed information:** When filling out the pitch form, be as descriptive as possible about your song. Specify the genre, mood, instruments, and language of your track. This helps the curators know exactly where your song fits.
* **Tell your story:** Curators want to know what makes your track unique. Include personal or engaging details, such as what inspired the song or why it’s significant to you. For example, if your song has a strong cultural or emotional story, don’t be afraid to share that.

Spotify has[ a guide on how to pitch your music](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/how-do-i-submit-music-to-spotify-s-editorial-team-for-playlist-consideration) to help you get started.


# 4. Building Your Case with Data


#### **Growing Your Listener Base**

Curators pay attention to numbers. Having a growing and engaged audience makes your track more attractive to playlist editors. You can boost your data by:



* Promoting pre-saves for your track
* Engaging fans on social media
* Driving traffic to your Spotify profile

Use[ Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/) to monitor your stream counts and demographic data, then leverage this information in your pitch.


#### **Leverage Social Proof**

If your track is gaining buzz on social media or blogs, include this in your pitch. Let curators know if your song has already generated excitement, whether through social media or other platforms like[ Hype Machine](https://hypem.com/).


#### **Utilize Pre-Saves and Promo**

Encouraging your fans to **pre-save your song** on Spotify can increase your chances of getting on algorithmic playlists like **Release Radar**. Pre-saves show curators and algorithms that there is existing demand for your track before it even drops.


# 5. Reaching Out to User-Generated Playlist Curators


#### **Research Playlist Curators**

Many influential user-generated playlists are managed by individuals or music influencers. Tools like[ Chartmetric](https://chartmetric.com/) and[ PlaylistSupply](https://playlistsupply.com/) can help you identify the right curators to contact.

Once you’ve found playlists that fit your genre, it’s time to reach out.


#### **Craft a Personalized Pitch**

When contacting playlist curators, keep your email or message concise but engaging. Here’s what you should include:



* A link to your song on Spotify (avoid attachments like MP3s).
* A brief introduction about yourself and your music.
* Explain why your song fits their playlist.

For example:


> Hi [Curator Name],
> My name is [Your Name], and I’m an independent R&B artist from Atlanta. I’ve recently released a track called [Song Name], and I think it would be a great fit for your playlist, [Playlist Name]. It has a soulful, laid-back vibe that complements the other songs on your list. Would you be interested in checking it out? Here’s the link: [Spotify Song Link].
> Thanks for your time, and I hope you enjoy the track!


#### **Follow Up, But Don’t Spam**

If you haven’t heard back within a week or two, it’s okay to follow up politely. But avoid sending multiple follow-ups within a short time frame. Building genuine relationships with curators is key to long-term success.


# 6. What to Do After Your Song Is Playlisted


#### **Promote Your Playlist Placement**

Once your song is added to a playlist, celebrate it! Share it across all your social media channels, email lists, and website. Tag the playlist and curator (if applicable), encouraging your fans to stream and share it.


#### **Track Performance and Build Relationships**

Keep an eye on how your song performs through **Spotify for Artists**. If it does well, it may land on more playlists, including algorithmic ones.

Additionally, maintaining relationships with playlist curators can open doors for future placements. A simple thank-you email or shout-out on social media can go a long way.


### **TLDR**

Pitching to Spotify playlists is both an art and a strategy. While competition is high, by ensuring your music is high-quality, crafting a personalized pitch, and strategically targeting the right curators, you increase your chances of landing those coveted playlist spots. Remember, persistence and patience are key, and every playlist placement is a step closer to building your career as an independent artist.
