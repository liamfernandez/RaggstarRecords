# Introduction
Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# Why Your Sessions are Unproductive
Let‚Äôs talk about why your sessions are unproductive. Are you spending hundreds of extra dollars on studio time just to come out with one extra unfinished song? Maybe you finally put a chorus on a new beat or figured out a melody after 30 minutes of repeating 1 take over and over. Maybe your engineer doesn‚Äôt know what he is doing and taking up an hour troubleshooting Pro Tools taking up your precious studio time.

Did you start writing your lyrics the night before the session just to scrap it as soon as you heard how you sounded on the beat? Are you rushing to the studio then wasting 20 minutes to roll your blunt before putting any bars down?  Do you have 10 people in the studio that contribute absolutely nothing to the session other than space and oxygen? If this is you, you have a problem.

# How to Prepare for a Session
Studio time is valuable time. Time that as independent artists, you have to pay for. As one of our clients once said that really resonated with me - ‚ÄúTime don‚Äôt stop for no man, no matter what‚Äù. As an artist, the studio is your job. Going to the studio and creating music is your job. Just because it isn‚Äôt a 9-5 doesn‚Äôt mean you you get to take days off whenever you want or come in to the office at any time. So we need to treat it as such.

Just like a job, you have a routine to adhere to. A schedule that defines your day and determines what you get done. If you want your music career to be a profitable venture, we need to prioritize it and make sure that your creative time and energy are being taken advantage of to its fullest extent. Let‚Äôs start with the basics:

1. **Punctuality is Key:** Arriving on time or even a bit early shows respect for the studio's schedule and allows you to maximize your booked session. Time in the studio is valuable, and punctuality ensures you're not rushing through your session.

2. **Come Prepared:** Have your material well-rehearsed and any tracks or beats you plan to use ready beforehand. This not only saves time but also allows you to focus on delivering your best performance.

3. **Limit Your Entourage:** Bringing too many people into the studio can be distracting and unproductive. If you need to have others with you, make sure they understand studio etiquette and their presence contributes positively to your session.

4. **Open Communication:** Clearly communicate your vision and needs with the engineer or producer. They're there to help you achieve your best work, so open and respectful communication is crucial.

5. **Take Breaks Wisely:** Recording can be intense, so take breaks to rest your voice or ears, but be mindful of the clock. Use breaks efficiently to refresh without losing too much valuable recording time.

# Build The Right Team
Having the right team of people around you is one of the most crucial parts of your career. If you don‚Äôt have supportive people around you to elevate you, keep you grounded, and in-check. Odds are you will burn-out or go crazy trying to do everything yourself. ‚ÄúIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together‚Äù. As an artist, you are the face of the business. You are what makes the money come in and the gears spin. Without you, nothing moves.

Since you are the head of the business you need a team of people working for you. Whether it‚Äôs your engineer, your manager, or your videographer. You need to experiment with different people to see who is a right fit for you. Maybe the same person that manages Lil Uzi isn‚Äôt the person you you need to manage you. Maybe the same engineer that produces for YoungBoy doesn‚Äôt know how to mix your sound. This will take some time but you will need to find who fits your personality and your budget.

The one thing we don‚Äôt recommend is getting your friends to play these roles for you. You don‚Äôt need to be going to your buddy‚Äôs studio down the road in the closet to try to record a billboard hit. And no, you don‚Äôt need to hire your aunty as your manager when she has never booked a show in her life and has no successful artists she has ever managed. If possible, you need to find people who are at a higher level than you are currently and pay the premium. But, at the end of the day, whatever makes the most sense for you is what needs to be exemplified and honed in. If getting your songs mixed and mastered at RaggStar makes the most sense for you, then don‚Äôt switch up üòâ

Here are a few reasons as to why you need experienced engineers and industry personnel around you. In the next blog we‚Äôll talk about how you can find this personnel to add to your team.

1. **Quality of Sound:** The right engineer knows how to use the studio's technology to its fullest potential, ensuring your recordings are of the highest quality. This is essential for standing out in a crowded market where listeners and industry professionals expect professional-grade sound.

2. **Creative Collaboration:** An engineer is not just a technical role but a creative one. They contribute to the sound and feel of your music, offering suggestions and creative ideas that can elevate your work. A good engineer will understand your vision and help bring it to life.

3. **Efficiency:** Experienced engineers work efficiently, saving you time and money in the long run. They can anticipate and solve problems quickly, keep sessions moving smoothly, and ensure you make the most of your studio time.

4. **Emotional Support:** The recording process can be emotionally taxing. A supportive engineer can make the experience more enjoyable and less stressful, acting as a confidant and sometimes even a mediator if the session involves multiple people.

Absolutely just as necessary is a good manager and a good videographer! Alongside having a great engineer and making the most out of your time, these two offer a foundation for building a successful music career. Here‚Äôs what value they can provide to you:

1. **The Value of a Good Manager:** A good manager plays a pivotal role in an artist's career. They help navigate the music industry, secure opportunities, and allow artists to focus on their creative process. A manager with the right connections and knowledge can open doors that might otherwise remain closed. They strategize your growth, handle negotiations, and provide career guidance, acting as a crucial bridge between your art and the business side of music.

2. **The Impact of a Quality Videographer:** Visual content is as important as the music itself. A talented videographer who understands your artistic vision can significantly enhance your brand. High-quality music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and promotional content help in engaging with your audience, telling your story, and standing out in a crowded digital landscape. A videographer who aligns with your creative goals can translate your music into compelling visual narratives, expanding your reach and impact.

# Get Serious
If you can follow these steps outlined above, there is no telling how high the ceiling on your career can be. We can‚Äôt tell you how many artists we have seen come to the studio for vanity. Not there to actually work but just to show off that they're in the studio because it‚Äôs the cool thing to do nowadays. If you want to become a full-time artist, you need to treat yourself like a full-time artist and hold yourself accountable to the same standard someone like Taylor Swfit does. The belief in oneself shows in person and on the mic. So be bold. Be confident! There is no hiding yourself anymore in this world. Your work will speak for itself. If you put in the time, money and effort, the results will be astonishing. On the other hand, if you half-ass your recordings and cheap out on quality, you or your fans won‚Äôt be satisfied with the product. If you have to work a full-time job to pay for studio time, then so be it. Take pride in your art and everything that you do. Because one day, all that sacrifice and hardwork will pay off. As always, we are here to help and would love to hear from you.
