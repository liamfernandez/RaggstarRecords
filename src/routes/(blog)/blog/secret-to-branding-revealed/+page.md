# Introduction

Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives that are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to a small business owner starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artist who dreams of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**

# What is a Brand?

Business and branding go together like peanut butter and jelly. If you have one without the other, you‚Äôre not going to enjoy the outcome. And if you do, that‚Äôs kind of weird.

![pbj_gif]({gif1})

First, let‚Äôs talk about what the essence of a business is. Business is a delicate relationship between a producer and consumer. The producer provides a product or service that the consumer deems as valuable and exchanges their money for that product or service. Very simple concept. Now, there are millions and millions of businesses in the world. Let me ask you a question. Do you think every single one of those business owners are hugley successful millionaires? The answer is no. Absolutely not. The harsh reality is that only about **30% of ALL businesses** last 10 years or longer. And out of this bunch, a much smaller percentage of them actually turn a major profit. What I am getting at here is that it is extremely difficult for business to stay alive. SO how does one become successful. Well, let‚Äôs dissect that relationship aspect again. Business at its core is a relationship between two parties.

**Keyword: Relationship**. The brand of a business is what fosters the relationship and this is a how a business or entity can set itself apart from the competition. Let‚Äôs play a game to demonstrate the psychology of branding.

![brand images]({img1})

Without having any other context clues, your brain associates the above images with Nike, Jordan, and Apple (from left to right). We associate Nike with athletes, Jordan with basketball, and Apple with iPhones/technology. It seems like a no-brainer, but in reality this took decades of work these companies to build that sense of trust in their relationship with their clients. We shop with Apple because their tech is seamless - **almost like magic**. We shop at Nike because we see our favoirte athletes draped in there clothing - and we think if you have on the new Nike trainers maybe you can run as fast as Usain Bolt.

This is the subliminal messaging these companies use to create trust between their product and you. Imagine a world where you walk into a grocery store and there are hundreds of loafs of bread on the shelves and the packaging on each one of the loaves just says ‚ÄúBread‚Äù. As generic as it can get.

![bread on shelf]({img2})

How do you know which loaf is the best quality? How do you know if the company that made that loaf of bread is trustworthy or has a good reputation? How do you know if this bread is a different flavor from the others? The answer is You don‚Äôt know. Without the presence of messaging, branding, or any effort to build trust or the relationship. You have no idea what the company has to offer or if they are even a viable option.

Why are designer brands like Gucci, YSL, and Chanel so popular? Hint hint it‚Äôs not because they donate a bunch of money to charity. It is because they **elicit exclusivity**. Their barrier to entry is their price point and discounts are unheard of in their world. But here‚Äôs the thing. They do not cater to the average human. They are branding this **mark of inclusion** for high net-worth individuals. The status symbol that comes with owning a piece of their collection is worth way more than the actual item you bought. In our society, people put this type of status on a pedastal due to the stigma about wealth in the US. These high-fashion designer brands spent decades building their brand catered towards the wealthy. They found their people and they put an emphasis on them.

Branding is how entities craft their story and inevitably **create their world**. What makes this entity tick? What are their principles? What do they stand on? What do they want to do for the world? What is their purpose? What do they offer to its consumer? All of these questions are answered by the entity‚Äôs brand. And if an entity can‚Äôt answer these questions through their brand messaging, their brand is simply not working.

# Why Does It Matter?

OK cool, that was a lot of information. So why does it matter? And what does this have to do with being an artist? Let‚Äôs start with what Branding is for Independent Artists?

Branding for independent artists is like crafting your musical identity and story. It's more than just your music; it's your style, your image, your message, and how you connect with your audience. Think of it as the album cover for your entire career. It's what makes you, you, and differentiates you from the countless other artists out there.

### Why is Branding Important for Independent Artists?

1. **Stand Out** in a Crowded Market: Just like a unique album cover catches your eye, strong branding helps you stand out. In a digital world where new music is released every second, your brand helps you shine brighter than the rest.
2. **Builds a Strong Connection** with Your Audience: Your branding tells your story and expresses your values. It's how you communicate with your fans on a deeper level, beyond just your music. This connection turns casual listeners into loyal fans who will follow your journey, attend your shows, and support your music.
3. **Creates Consistency** Across All Platforms: Whether it's your social media, merchandise, or music videos, your branding ensures consistency. This cohesive image makes you easily recognizable and professional, building trust and credibility with your audience.

### Why is Branding Important for Fans?

1. **Guides Discovery:** Fans are always on the lookout for new music that resonates with them. Your branding acts as a beacon, attracting listeners who share your values and appreciate your style. It helps fans discover music that feels like it was made just for them.
2. Fosters a **Sense of Belonging**: Fans don't just follow artists for their music; they're drawn to their story, ethos, and community. A strong brand fosters a sense of belonging among fans, creating a community that shares common interests and values.
3. **Enhances the Music** Experience: Your branding adds layers to the music experience. It's the visual and emotional backdrop to your songs, making each listen more immersive. Fans don't just hear your music; they experience your brand in every note.

![takeoff dab]({gif3})

We all remember when ‚Äúthe dab‚Äù came out. Don‚Äôt lie we know you were hitting it too üòè. The Migos made this synonymous with their music. This dance move added a huge boost to their already famous brand. Even though this was a short-lived era, every dance video on Vine and YouTube included the dab which bolstered the Migos‚Äô career to new heights. It captured a wider audience of pop culture that typically would not listen to their music but was able to funnel and convert non-listeners into new fans.

Branding is your voice in the silence, your signature on every piece of art you create. It's critical because it's not just about getting noticed; it's about creating an enduring connection with your audience. This connection is what sustains an artist's career, turning fleeting listens into lifelong fanhood.

In the digital age, where music is ubiquitous, branding is the story that makes people press play, wear your merchandise, and buy tickets to your shows. It's the heart of your music career's business side, ensuring that your art finds its audience and your voice is heard amid the noise.

So, for all the independent artists out there, remember that your music is your message, but your brand is your voice. Let it be authentic, let it resonate, and let it echo in the hearts of your fans. That's the power of branding in the music industry, transforming not just careers, but lives.

# How to Get Rich Off Your Brandü§ë

Let‚Äôs talk about the concept of **World-Building**. This is something that all the greats in any creative space have been able to achieve. World-building, a term often associated with the realms of literature and film, especially in genres like fantasy and science fiction, is the process of creating a detailed universe that your characters, stories, and themes inhabit. However, this concept isn't confined to just books and movies; it's a powerful tool for artists in music to develop a unique and immersive brand that captivates and engages audiences on a deeper level. For an artist, world-building means crafting a cohesive and immersive environment around your music. This environment includes the themes, stories, visuals, and personality that your music embodies. It's about creating a unique universe that listeners can step into, where every song, album, music video, and piece of merchandise contributes to the narrative and feel of this world.

![this my world]({img3})

You see, fans are not just looking for music; they're seeking experiences that resonate with them. By offering a rich, engaging world, you invite listeners into an experience that goes beyond the auditory. This deeper engagement fosters a stronger, more emotional connection with your audience, turning casual listeners into loyal fans. A **strong, visually cohesive world** opens up myriad opportunities for creative merchandising. Fans love to own a piece of their favorite universe, whether it's themed apparel, posters, or even unique experiences related to your world. This not only enhances fan engagement but also creates additional revenue streams.

World-building allows you to **add layers of meaning** to your music. Themes, characters, and stories from your world can weave through your songs, giving fans more to discover with each listen. This narrative depth can make your music more compelling and rewarding for audiences who enjoy exploring and interpreting art. A well-defined world offers a blueprint for consistency across all your branding and marketing efforts. From your website and social media presence to your live performances and music videos, every touchpoint with your audience reinforces the elements of your unique universe, creating a cohesive and immersive brand experience.

This loyalty not only increases the likelihood of fans attending live shows and buying merchandise but also creates advocates for the artist's brand, expanding their reach through word-of-mouth and social sharing.

The immersive worlds artists create offer a canvas for storytelling, which can be explored through music videos, social media content, live performances, and even interactive platforms. This storytelling adds layers of engagement, encouraging fans to spend more time within the artist's universe, exploring its depths and nuances. As fans become more invested in the world and its narratives, **they're more inclined to support the artist financially**, whether through purchasing music, merchandise, or exclusive experiences that offer deeper immersion into the artist's creative vision.

You can also leverage their world-building efforts to **create exclusive experiences**, such as themed live shows, virtual reality experiences, or interactive online platforms, that offer fans unique ways to engage with their music and its universe. These experiences, often unavailable elsewhere, can be monetized, providing artists with additional income streams while enhancing fan engagement. Furthermore, the distinctiveness of a well-crafted world can **attract partnerships and collaborations with brands, creators, and media properties**, opening up opportunities for licensing, cross-promotion, and sponsored content. These partnerships not only provide direct financial benefits but also increase exposure to new potential fans, expanding the artist's audience and marketability.

In the digital age, where content is abundant and attention spans are short, world-building sets artists apart, transforming their music into an experience that fans are eager to explore, share, and invest in.

# Keep Going

Building a brand and a world will require a lot of hardwork, consistency and dedication. All of the examples mentioned in this article took 5 years at the least to grow and program into their fans minds. The great part about this is that you control the narrative. You are the main character in your own unique story. No one can take that away from you. The body of work that you create over the next decade will inevitably be extremely valuable to you and your fans. As always we are here for you and encourage you along your journey.
