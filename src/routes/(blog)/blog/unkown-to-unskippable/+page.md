# Introduction
Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives who are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to being a small business owner who is starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artists who dream of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. **In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.**
